# AI Governance and Security Accelerator

This accelerator knits together Microsoft 365, Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure AI Foundry, and ChatGPT Enterprise so AI solutions inherit the same governance and security posture as the rest of the enterprise. All automation is spec driven: copy the shared template (`spec.dspm.template.json`) to an environment-specific file (for example `spec.local.json`) that feeds the atomic PowerShell modules provisioning resources, enabling compliance controls, and lighting up monitoring across tenants.

- **PowerShell 7 required** – run every script (including `run.ps1`) from pwsh 7.x to avoid Windows PowerShell module loader conflicts.
- **Az module installed** – install or update the Az rollup before running anything:

  ```powershell
  pwsh
  Install-Module Az -Scope CurrentUser -Force
  Install-Module Az.Security -Scope CurrentUser -Force    # defender steps
  ```

- **Purview DSPM for AI** discovers, classifies, and protects data used by AI workloads in Microsoft Foundry, Microsoft 365, Fabric, OneLake, and connected Azure services.
- **Defender for AI** enables threat detection (prompt injection, jailbreak, exfiltration) and routes evidence into SIEM or Purview.
- **Azure AI Foundry + ChatGPT Enterprise** gain Content Safety policies, audit trails, and resource tagging so every prompt, response, and deployment can be governed.

---

## Prerequisites

- **PowerShell 7** and **Azure CLI **authenticated to the target subscriptions.
- **Microsoft 365 E5** (or **E5 compliance**) license assigned to an operator with **Compliance Administrator** and **Purview Data Source Administrator rights** ([Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ai-microsoft-purview-considerations#prerequisites-for-data-security-posture-management-for-ai)).
- **Exchange Online Management module** installed on a workstation capable of satisfying MFA for audit enablement steps ([Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell)).
- The **operator** running the Microsoft 365 tag (`run.ps1 -Tags m365`) must hold **Unified Audit** roles (Compliance Administrator, Organization Management, or Audit Admin). Without those permissions Exchange will report "completed successfully but no settings modified" when toggling `Set-AdminAuditLogConfig`, so the scripts emit a warning and you must enable unified audit in the Purview/M365 Compliance portal instead.
- Run the Exchange Online steps (`run.ps1 -Tags m365`) from that workstation; containerized environments without a browser should execute the remaining tags (`dspm`, `defender`, `foundry`) separately. If you're staying on the desktop, you can combine everything in one go ([Modern auth with MFA guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exo-powershell#connect-to-exchange-online-powershell-using-modern-authentication-with-or-without-mfa)):
  ```powershell
  ./run.ps1 -Tags m365,dspm,defender,foundry -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
  # or, from bash/zsh: pwsh ./run.ps1 -Tags m365,dspm,defender,foundry -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
  ```
- Azure RBAC permissions: **Contributor** on the subscription that hosts Purview, AI Foundry, and Defender resources.

## Quick start

1. **Clone and install tooling** (PowerShell 7, Azure CLI) in your preferred shell.
2. **Review the spec template** – the repo includes `spec.dspm.template.json` (generated by `scripts/governance/00-New-DspmSpec.ps1`). Update it if the schema changes (the script skips overwriting existing files unless you pass `-Force`):

```powershell
pwsh ./scripts/governance/00-New-DspmSpec.ps1 -OutFile ./spec.dspm.template.json
```

3. **Fill in parameters** – copy `spec.dspm.template.json` to `spec.local.json`, populate tenant and resource IDs, and keep the local file untracked (see below).
4. **Execute the modules** – stay in the repo root and follow the same order every time (see the [Tag reference](#tag-reference) for more detail on each tag and additional combinations):
   - **Foundation (Purview landing zone):**
     ```powershell
     pwsh ./scripts/governance/01-Ensure-ResourceGroup.ps1 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     pwsh ./scripts/governance/dspmPurview/02-Ensure-PurviewAccount.ps1 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     ```
   - **Microsoft 365 compliance slice (requires local desktop + MFA):**
     ```powershell
     ./run.ps1 -Tags m365 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     # from bash/zsh use: pwsh ./run.ps1 -Tags m365 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     ```
     This single tag call connects to Exchange Online, turns on Unified Audit if needed, and publishes your Know Your Data/DLP/label/retention settings.
   - **Purview registrations and scans:**
     ```powershell
     pwsh ./scripts/governance/dspmPurview/03-Register-DataSource.ps1 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     pwsh ./scripts/governance/dspmPurview/04-Run-Scan.ps1 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     ```
   - **Defender for AI posture:**
     ```powershell
     pwsh ./scripts/defender/defenderForAI/06-Enable-DefenderPlans.ps1 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     pwsh ./scripts/defender/defenderForAI/07-Enable-Diagnostics.ps1 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     ```
   - **Foundry registration + Content Safety:**
     ```powershell
     pwsh ./scripts/governance/dspmPurview/30-Foundry-RegisterResources.ps1 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     pwsh ./scripts/governance/dspmPurview/31-Foundry-ConfigureContentSafety.ps1 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     ```
   - **Optional orchestrator:** skip the individual calls above and drive the same steps via tags:
     ```powershell
     ./run.ps1 -Tags m365 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     ./run.ps1 -Tags dspm,defender,foundry -SpecPath ./spec.local.json
     ```
     Tags can be combined however you like (for example `-Tags foundation,dspm` for just the Purview pieces).

### Defender for Cloud plan choices

Populate `defenderForAI.enableDefenderForCloudPlans` (in `spec.dspm.template.json` or your local copy) with every Defender for Cloud plan you want the automation to enable before Defender for AI correlates findings. Common values include:

- `CognitiveServices` (shows as **AI Services** in the Defender for Cloud blade) – guardrails for Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI, and other Cognitive Services accounts that host prompts, responses, or model orchestration.
- `Storage` – coverage for Storage accounts holding prompt transcripts, audit exports, embeddings, or fine-tuning payloads.
- `Containers` – Defender for Containers for AKS/Fabric scenarios where containerized agents run inference pipelines.
- `KeyVaults` – detection around vaults storing model keys, Content Safety secrets, or managed identities.
- `AppServices` and `Api` – surface exploits or drift on App Service / API Management front ends used by prompt flow apps.
- `ContainerRegistry` – protect custom model images prior to deployment.
- `KubernetesService` and `VirtualMachines` – telemetry from GPU clusters or VM pools hosting self-managed inference.
- `ResourceManager` (a.k.a. `Arm`) – watch for control-plane changes that might weaken AI guardrails.
- `SqlServers`, `SqlServersOnVirtualMachines`, `OpenSourceRelationalDatabases`, `CosmosDbs` – when AI workloads persist chat history, embeddings, or feature stores in those data services.
- `ContainerApp` and `Dns` – helpful when exposing AI agents through Container Apps or public endpoints.

Add or remove plan strings as needed; the `06-Enable-DefenderPlans.ps1` module iterates the array and skips any plan already turned on in the subscription.

**Manual Purview action (until API support ships):** after `30-Foundry-RegisterResources.ps1` and `31-Foundry-ConfigureContentSafety.ps1` finish, sign into the Purview portal and navigate to **Data Security Posture > Recommendations > Secure interactions for enterprise AI apps** (a.k.a. **Capture interactions for enterprise AI apps**). Enable the recommendation for each Azure AI Foundry account/project that will publish chats. The "Enable Data Security for AI Interactions" switch cannot be set via API yet, so this manual step is required to collect Foundry chat interactions (see [Use Microsoft Purview to manage data security & compliance for Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ai-azure-foundry#getting-started-recommended-steps)).

**Know Your Data capture (KYD):** run `./run.ps1 -Tags m365 -SpecPath ./spec.local.json` from a local PowerShell 7 session whenever you need to (re)enable Unified Audit, create the Secure interactions/KYD policy, or publish the DLP/label/retention settings baked into your spec. The script loads the Exchange Online Management module, prompts for MFA in your default browser, and creates the policy that stores prompts/responses in each user’s mailbox so the data inherits retention, eDiscovery, and Communication Compliance. See `docs/dspm-sales-narrative.md` (steps 2–3) and the Microsoft Learn article on [turning auditing on or off](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-enable-disable) for the exact operator walkthrough and objection handling.

**Why the registration script matters:** `30-Foundry-RegisterResources.ps1` walks the `aiFoundry` and `foundry.resources[]` blocks in `spec.local.json`, validates each resource, and writes the metadata Purview’s DSPM blades use to associate Azure AI Foundry projects with your broader AI estate. Without that registration pass, Defender for Cloud may still discover the workspace, but Purview cannot correlate the DSPM recommendation state or surface “Secure interactions for enterprise AI apps” for that project, which is why rerunning the script keeps recommendations aligned with the rest of your environment.

**Content Safety script behavior:** if `foundry.contentSafety` is missing, the script logs "No foundry.contentSafety" and skips configuration so the rest of the tag run continues. When an endpoint is present but the Key Vault secret info is omitted or local auth is disabled, the script automatically requests an Entra ID access token for `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com` (works with system-assigned managed identities) and uses it to call the Content Safety REST APIs. Supplying a Key Vault secret still works when you prefer key-based auth. In either mode, every Foundry project listed under `foundry.resources` inherits the blocklists/items defined in the spec.

5. **Review dashboards** in Purview and Defender, then export evidence with `17-Export-ComplianceInventory.ps1` and `21-Export-Audit.ps1`.

---

## How the story comes together

1. **Author the spec** – capture tenant, subscriptions, Purview account, Azure AI assets, data sources, and compliance intent in your local copy (for example `spec.local.json`).
2. **Run atomic modules** – invoke only the scripts you need (or call `run.ps1` with tags) to ensure prerequisites, enable compliance services, create policies, and register data sources.
3. **Validate posture** – use the verification modules to confirm Defender plans, audit ingestion, and Purview policy status, then hand the spec to ops for day-two governance.

---

## Capabilities at a glance

- **Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI**: register storage, SQL, OneLake, and Fabric workspaces, trigger Purview DSPM for AI scans, and apply sensitivity labels, DLP policies, and retention rules so AI workloads (Azure AI Foundry and ChatGPT Enterprise) inherit Microsoft Purview’s DSPM controls.
- **Security posture**: assign Azure Policies, enable Defender for Cloud plans, and ship diagnostics to Log Analytics for continuous monitoring of AI endpoints.
- **Compliance evidence**: subscribe to the Management Activity API, export audit logs, and push transcripts into storage or Fabric for downstream analytics.
- **Application guardrails**: configure Content Safety blocklists, tag Azure resources with compliance metadata, and lay the groundwork for AI prompt filtering in ChatGPT Enterprise.

## Automation flow & manual checkpoints

Legend: ✅ = scripted/automated, 🔶 = operator completes manually in portal or desktop PowerShell session.

```
[Spec ready in PowerShell 7] (✅)
  |
  v
[./run.ps1 -Tags foundation,dspm] (✅) → Purview account, scans, policies, diagnostics
  |
  v
[Manual Purview toggle: Secure interactions for enterprise AI apps] (🔶)
  |
  v

[Manual review: verify dashboards, upload evidence, approve previews if required] (🔶)
```

Manual steps exist where Microsoft has not yet exposed APIs or where MFA-capable desktop sessions are mandatory (Exchange Online, Purview preview toggles). Keep this diagram handy when planning customer demos so you can assign owners before the run.

### Required manual checkpoints

1. **Secure interactions / KYD toggle (Purview portal)**
  - Navigate to **https://web.purview.azure.com** → **Data Security Posture** → **Recommendations** → **Secure interactions for enterprise AI apps**.
  - Select every Azure AI Foundry account/project that will emit chats and choose **Enable**. This is the only way to flip the “Capture interactions for enterprise AI apps” switch today.
  - Revisit after each new Foundry project is registered; the automation cannot satisfy this control via API yet.
2. **Exchange Online desktop session for `m365` tag**
  - Open PowerShell 7 on a workstation with browser-based MFA, install/update the Exchange Online Management module, and run `./run.ps1 -Tags m365 -ConnectM365 -M365UserPrincipalName <upn>`.
  - Approve the MFA prompts, confirm Unified Audit reports “Enabled,” and verify the Secure interactions (KYD) policy appears under **Data lifecycle management** in the Purview portal.
3. **Communication Compliance / Insider Risk previews**
  - In the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, browse to **Communication Compliance** and **Insider Risk Management** to enable any required preview policies or monitoring templates (for example sensitive keywords, channel monitoring, or policy templates tied to AI prompts).
  - Document approvals with screenshots or exports; these features remain portal-only.
4. **Post-run review and evidence capture**
  - Check Defender for Cloud, Purview DSPM dashboards, and Azure Policy compliance to ensure new registrations/scans are reflected.
  - Run `17-Export-ComplianceInventory.ps1` / `21-Export-Audit.ps1` only after confirming telemetry is flowing, then upload the artifacts to your evidence repository (SharePoint, Fabric, or storage account) for audit traceability.
  - If Fabric scans are enabled later, confirm in the Purview portal that the scan job completed successfully; rerun manually when changes occur.

Use this checklist with your change plan/runbook so stakeholders understand which steps require human interaction and which ones the automation handles.

Use whichever combination suits your workflow (for example, `-Tags m365` from a workstation, then `-Tags dpsm,defender,foundry` from Cloud Shell). Documenting the tags keeps the intent clear until we refactor or rename them.

## Spec management

- The repo tracks a sanitized contract in `spec.dspm.template.json`. Update it when the schema evolves so customers always have an authoritative sample.
- Create your working copy via `Copy-Item ./spec.dspm.template.json ./spec.local.json` (or the equivalent). This file is listed in `.gitignore` so it stays on your machine.
- Pass `-SpecPath ./spec.local.json` (or any other filename you choose) when running modules. `run.ps1` defaults to `./spec.local.json` and prints a friendly error if the file is missing.
- For multiple environments, create additional local files such as `spec.dev.json` and point `run.ps1 -SpecPath` to the one you need. Keep secrets in Key Vault rather than the spec.
- Fabric + OneLake placeholders live under `fabric.oneLakeRoots[]` and `fabric.workspaces[]`. Scripts `26-29` in `run.ps1` are commented out until they can gracefully ignore empty arrays, so populate these blocks now and uncomment the lines when you are ready to register/scan Fabric resources.
- Need to postpone an Azure Policy assignment? Set `"enabled": false` on that entry in `azurePolicies`. The assignment script logs the skip and leaves the declaration in place for later.
- Want a field-by-field explanation? See `docs/spec-local-reference.md` for the table that maps each spec parameter to the scripts that consume it.
- Know Your Data evidence flow is fully spec-driven: the `dlpPolicy`, `labels`, and `retentionPolicies` blocks define what the `m365` tag publishes, while `activityExport` controls the Management Activity/Audit offload that keeps KYD prompts and alerting in sync. Pair this README with `docs/dspm-sales-narrative.md` to brief operators on the why/how.

## Script families

| Folder                           | Purpose                                                                                         | Highlights                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/governance`             | Spec management, Purview account bootstrap, policy creation, audit exports, Foundry integration | `00-New-DspmSpec.ps1`, `02-Ensure-PurviewAccount.ps1`, `12-Create-DlpPolicy.ps1`, `30-Foundry-RegisterResources.ps1` |
| `scripts/defender/defenderForAI` | Enable Defender for Cloud AI plans, diagnostics, and integrations                               | `06-Enable-DefenderPlans.ps1`, `07-Enable-Diagnostics.ps1`                                                           |
| `scripts/exchangeOnline`         | Security and Compliance PowerShell prerequisites (behind the `m365` tag)                        | `10-Connect-Compliance.ps1`, `11-Enable-UnifiedAudit.ps1`                                                            |

Each script is idempotent and checks for prerequisites before applying changes. Combine them in CI, during `azd up`, or as one-off remediation tools.

## Next steps

1. Populate `spec.dspm.template.json` as the customer-facing contract and keep per-environment copies such as `spec.local.json` out of source control (store secrets in Key Vault).
2. Wire the atomic modules into your CI/CD or Azure Developer CLI pipeline by calling `run.ps1` with the appropriate tags.
3. Extend the stubs (`15-Create-SensitiveInfoType-Stub.ps1`, `23-Ship-AuditToFabricLakehouse-Stub.ps1`, `32-Foundry-GenerateBindings-Stub.ps1`) to meet organization-specific requirements.

With the spec as the contract, the accelerator keeps Microsoft 365 compliance, Defender telemetry, and Azure AI workloads aligned so AI apps stay governed from prompt to production.
