## Important Security Notice

This template, the application code and configuration it contains, has been built to showcase Microsoft Azure specific services and tools. We strongly advise our customers not to make this code part of their production environments without implementing or enabling additional security features.

Organizations deploying AI across Microsoft 365 Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, and custom agents face a common challenge: **how do you govern AI interactions at scale while maintaining compliance?**

A data protection team is tasked with securing AI workloads across the enterprise. They need to:

- **Discover** where AI interactions occur - which apps, which data sources, which users
- **Classify** sensitive data flowing through AI prompts and responses
- **Protect** data with policies that prevent sensitive information from leaking through AI systems
- **Monitor** AI interactions through audit logs and compliance dashboards
- **Demonstrate** compliance to regulators with exportable evidence

Without automation, this requires significant manual configuration across multiple portals: Purview, Defender for Cloud, Azure Policy, Exchange Online, and more. Each AI project means repeating the same steps.

**This accelerator solves that problem.** Capture your governance requirements in a single spec file, run `azd up`, and produce verifiable evidence that DSPM for AI and Defender for AI are enforcing policies, logging activity, and keeping every AI workflow compliant.

## <img src="./docs/images/readme/solution-overview.png" width="48" alt="Solution Overview" /> Solution overview

This accelerator orchestrates Azure and Microsoft 365 governance artifacts through PowerShell and Azure Developer CLI hooks:

- Automates Purview DSPM for AI onboarding (resource groups, Purview account checks, data-source registration, scans, DLP/label/retention policies, audit exports)
- Governs Azure AI Foundry projects with Azure Policy, Defender for Cloud, Content Safety blocklists, diagnostics, and tagging
- Ships telemetry to Log Analytics and exports compliance evidence for downstream analytics or regulators
- Provides repeatable CI/Desktop experiences through spec-controlled tags and azd post-provision hooks

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Spec-driven DSPM for AI enablement** | Copy `spec.dspm.template.json`, populate tenant data, and let the scripts create Purview accounts, data sources, scans, KYD/DLP/retention policies, and audit exports without portal clicks. |
| **Cross-cloud posture telemetry** | Stream diagnostics to Log Analytics, ensure Secure Interactions/KYD capture prompts and responses, and collect compliance inventory snapshots for auditors. |
| **CI + desktop friendly automation** | Run `azd up` to replay deterministic checklists in devcontainers, Codespaces, or local shells. |
| **Extensible evidence exports** | Reuse the audit export, compliance inventory, and tagging scripts as building blocks for bespoke regulator packages or SIEM pipelines. |

## Getting Started

## <img src="./docs/images/readme/quick-deploy.png" width="48" alt="Quick Deploy" /> Quick deploy

Deploy this solution to your Azure subscription using the Azure Developer CLI.

> **Note:** This solution accelerator requires Azure Developer CLI (azd) version 1.9.0 or higher. Please ensure you have the latest version installed before proceeding with deployment. [Download azd here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

[Click here to launch the deployment guide](./docs/DeploymentGuide.md)

| [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/Data-Agent-Governance-and-Security-Accelerator) | [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Agent-Governance-and-Security-Accelerator) |
| --- | --- |

> **Important:** Check Azure resource availability. To ensure the required services and permissions are available in your subscription and region, review the [Prerequisites and costs](#prerequisites-and-costs) section before deploying.

### How to install or deploy

**1. Sign in to Azure:**
```powershell
az login
azd auth login
Connect-AzAccount -Tenant <tenantId> -Subscription <subscriptionId>
Set-AzContext -Subscription <subscriptionId>
```

**2. Prepare the spec file:**
`azd up` now runs a preprovision hook that creates `spec.local.json` if it doesn't exist, with the minimum required fields populated from your azd/az CLI context (tenant, subscription, resource group, location) and empty placeholders for optional sections.

If you prefer to scaffold manually:
```powershell
Copy-Item ./spec.dspm.template.json ./spec.local.json
```
```bash
# Bash command
cp ./spec.dspm.template.json ./spec.local.json
```
Edit `spec.local.json` with your tenant ID, subscription ID, Purview account details, and AI Foundry project information. For optional sections, copy blocks from [docs/spec-example.json](docs/spec-example.json).

**3. Deploy:**
```powershell
azd up
```

**4. Complete manual steps** (see below)

> **Need alternative deployment options?** See [Alternative Deployment Paths](./docs/AlternativeDeploymentPaths.md) for run.ps1 tags, M365 desktop deployment, CI/CD integration, and GitHub Actions workflows.

> **Something go wrong?** See [Undo and Rollback](./docs/AlternativeDeploymentPaths.md#undo-and-rollback) for cleanup steps, partial deployment recovery, and `azd down` guidance.

### Post-deployment manual steps

After automation completes, you **MUST** manually enable several settings that cannot be automated via API:

| Portal | Toggle | Navigation | Purpose |
|--------|--------|------------|---------|
| **Defender for Cloud** | Enable user prompt evidence | Azure portal → Defender for Cloud → Environment settings → [subscription] → AI services → Settings | Includes suspicious prompt segments in Defender alerts |
| **Defender for Cloud** | Enable data security for AI interactions | Azure portal → Defender for Cloud → Environment settings → [subscription] → AI services → Settings | Connects Azure AI telemetry to Purview DSPM for AI |
| **Microsoft Purview** | Activate Microsoft Purview Audit | Purview portal → DSPM for AI → Overview → Get Started | Required for audit log ingestion |
| **Microsoft Purview** | Secure interactions from enterprise apps | Purview portal → DSPM for AI → Recommendations | KYD collection policy for enterprise AI apps |

**Why this matters:** Without these manual toggles, AI interaction data (prompts/responses) will NOT be captured by Purview DSPM or Defender for AI for threat detection and compliance analysis.

### Prerequisites and costs

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create resource groups, resources, and assign roles.

**Microsoft Purview Pre-requisite permissions checklist:**
- Ensure your existing Purview account is assigned with below two roles as a Managed Identity on Subscription level:
    - Storage Blob Data Reader role
    - Reader role
- Purview Data Security and Posture Management (DSPM) for AI access
- Purview - Data Security AI Content Viewer role

**Required permissions on M365 level:**
- Contributor role at the subscription level
- Role Based Access Control Administrator on the subscription and/or resource group level
- Microsoft 365 E5 (or E5 Compliance) license for the operator enabling Secure Interactions
- Compliance Administrator role
- Exchange online Administrator role

**Required tooling:**
- Azure CLI 2.58.0+
- Azure Developer CLI (azd) 1.9.0+
- PowerShell 7.x with Az modules

![DSPM for all services](./docs/doc-images/DSPM-for-all-services-steps.png)

A data protection program is tasked with lighting up Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management for AI and Microsoft Defender for AI across Microsoft 365 Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, Fabric, and bespoke agentic solutions.

They must:
- Discover and classify the source data that feeds every agent
- Apply Purview labels, DLP, and retention policies plus Defender guardrails
- Continuously track and audit Generative AI apps and agents for regulators

With this accelerator, the team captures those requirements in a spec file, executes `azd up`, and produces verifiable evidence that DSPM for AI and Defender for AI are enforcing policies, logging activity, and keeping every AI workflow compliant.
