# Stubs

These scripts are placeholders for optional or not-yet-implemented steps. They are kept here for future expansion and to preserve the expected entry points while the implementation is developed.

- `Create-BudgetAlert-Stub.ps1`
- `Create-SensitiveInfoType-Stub.ps1`
- `Create-TrainableClassifier-Stub.ps1`
- `Foundry-GenerateBindings-Stub.ps1`
- `Ship-AuditToFabricLakehouse-Stub.ps1`

Notes:
- These stubs are not invoked by the default run orchestration.
- Replace a stub with a real implementation when you are ready, or delete it if the capability is no longer needed.
